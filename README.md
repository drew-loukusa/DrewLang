# DrewLang
A custom programing language by me, Drew. In it's finished state, it will be a high level Python-style language with dynamic typing, but with optional type enforcement. My end goal is to learn the techniques and processes involved in designing and building a programming language and as such I do not intend to develop my language for wider release.
