I want to go through the book "Language Implementation Patterns" and use each 
of the patterns (or most, or some, it's up to you) to implement a small language. 

This langauge will NOT be fully featured. This lang would be a bare bones implementation. 
I'm not even sure I'll be able to call it a lang. I'm looking at this as being a testing ground 
for learning these patterns.
But hopelfully it would be enough to allow me to get a feel for these patterns and understand them 
well enough to apply them without having to reference the book. 

I guess after I've worked my way through the book, I can see if I want to expand this test lang into a bigger
lang. Could start over, but it really all depends on how messy this gets.

I anticipate it'll get messy, but again, just starting out so no idea.
